## Summary
With the rise of social media as a means to communicate, spread news, and share information, sentiment analysis is increasingly important. We will examine a slice of Twitter (now X) tweet data tagging several major US airlines to predict tweet sentiment. Benefits of sentiment analysis include:
- Increase the airlinesâ€™ ability to quickly respond to customer service issues
- Gauge public sentiment on a major social media platform
- Identify recurring customer service topics

A summary of the research methodology, findings, and conclusions are included in this [presentation](https://github.com/bscov/Group1_FinalProject/blob/main/Group1_FinalProjectPresentation.pdf).
## Methodology
This study employed Python and executed the code in Google Colab. The code utilized Python's Nltk, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow libraries, among others. The code and output are included in the [code folder](https://github.com/bscov/Group1_FinalProject/tree/main/Code). Visualizations were created using Python and PowerBI. Important visualizations are included in the [visualizations folder](https://github.com/bscov/Group1_FinalProject/tree/main/Visualizations). 
## Models
The researchers trained four models to predict the classification of tweet sentiment into three categories (positive, negative, and neutral):
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
## Results
- The GRU model achieved the highest accuracy of **98%** with precise classification across sentiment categories
- The Random Forest showed robust accuracy of **95.01%**, although slight misclassifications were observed between two categories
- The Naive Bayes achieved an overall accuracy of approximately **88.87%**, performing well with minimal misclassifications
- The LSTM obtained the lowest accuracy level of about **75%**, indicating potential for improvement
## Applications to Management
This research identifies the most promising model to continue tuning before deployment. This model can be applied to customer service workflows to expedite communication and complaint resolution on Twitter (now X). This model can also be utilized to identify commonly occurring complaint topics to direct operational focus.
